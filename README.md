## Overview

This is a simple Android app that supports user login to view content. Basic error checking is included. These are the current users and their passwords, use these logins to see the content.

Currently, the content is an MySQL database of actors hosted on cs.duke.edu, though that database will probably not be hosted for much long after the initial commit.
